# Tetrisimo

A game of Tetris built with Angular! This project is an educational exercise to get more familiar with Angular, so don't hesitate to get involved and contribute :)

## Requirements

In order to run this app locally, you will need to have an installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) which comes bundled with `npm`, a.k.a Node Package Manager. From here, you can use `npm` to install the Angular CLI using the command `npm install -g @angular/cli`  

## Contributing

To get up and running with this project, `git clone` the repository on your local machine. Once the repository is cloned, `cd` into the newly created project folder and run `npm install` to download all dependencies required by this app (specified in the package.json file). After you've installed all dependencies, host the app by running `ng serve` and navigate to localhost:4200 to see your locally hosted Tetrisimo app in action!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.14.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
